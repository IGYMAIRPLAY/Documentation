<p>Players interact with an augmented reality projected ball and attempt to score on the other side of the field. Players have expandable peripersonal boundaries that allow them to virtually kick the ball. The peripersonal boundaries can either be expanded by extending their limbs, or by pressing a Bluetooth kick button if they have limited mobility.</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>After going through the quick tutorials, the game begins when the moderator starts the timer. A timer will be correspondingly displayed at the center of the field. Players with the kick button should be assigned to the left side of the field and all players should try to stay on their side of the field. This is because the algorithm is programmed to only expand peripersonal boundaries on the left side of the field. By kicking the ball into the goal on the other side, the player scores a point. At the end of the timer, the winner, or the side with the most points, will have a crown displayed on their field.</p>
