init_background() Function: This function initializes the background image. It can either capture the initial frame as a background (when enable_flag is set to 1) or load a background image from a file.
background_subtraction() Function: The background_subtraction() function takes the current frame and the background image as input and performs background subtraction.
average_frame() Function: This function computes the average of a sequence of frames.
detect_pos() Function: This function handles object detection and tracking. It captures frames from a camera, performs background subtraction, and then identifies and tracks objects in the scene.
Publisher Node (PublisherNode): The published data includes the number of detected objects, their positions (x and y coordinates), and sizes. Timing information is also included for performance evaluation.
Subscriber Node (SingleThreadedNode): This is a simple subscriber node that listens for control messages. (Currently is not used)
