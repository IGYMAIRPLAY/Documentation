## Introduction 

Welcome to the ros2-emulation wiki! ros2-emulation is the repository for the ROS2 part of the entire [iGYM system](https://www.igym.solutions/). iGYM aims to build games that are inclusive and fun for people of all abilities. We use projectors to display a virtual game field for players to physically interact with. Through the implementation of peripersonal boundaries and kick buttons, we level the playing field between people with motor disabilities and their non-disabled peers.

The code in this repository is responsible for implementing the player detection in the iGYM system using OpenCV.

The current most up-to-date branch that is used for the onsite play field is the OnsiteVersion branch.

This section is still in progress...

## Requirements
* Windows 10
* ROS2 foxy

## Installation

### ROS2 foxy

[Here]([Windows (binary) â€” ROS 2 Documentation: Foxy documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary.html)) is the installation for ROS2 foxy official document (You might encounter some errors later while building the workspace)

[Here](https://ms-iot.github.io/ROSOnWindows/GettingStarted/SetupRos2.html) is an alternative way to install (only in disk C) (recommended)

## Development

### Branches

* **OnsiteVersion**: This branch is for testing the system on-site at Packard's Field.
* **3_09_video_test**: This branch is for testing the system with the video recordings taken from on-site. Due to the video's size exceeding the maximum size to push to GitHub, make sure to download the video from this (link)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPAa-w7rQWaxT7_s6YWcZ-Tj5pzy42DI/view?usp=drive_link], and store it in the /ap_interfaces/test_video/ directory before running the program.
* **table-demo**: This branch is for testing the system on our table demo. There is no button logic for the table-demo branch.

### Running procedure

Open a terminal:

`c:\opt\ros\foxy\x64\setup.bat`  Source the setup file

`cd C:\[Path To The Repo]\ros2_emulation\src` 

`colcon build --merge-install --packages-select ap_interfaces` only build ap_interfaces or if you want to build all: `colcon build --merge-install`Everytime you made a change you need to build it.

`call install\setup.bat` Source the workspace

`ros2 launch ap_interfaces airplay_launch.py` to run the button and player_detection node or `ros2 run ap_interfaces player_detection` to run merely the player_detection node

Open another terminal (for connection with Unity):

`c:\opt\ros\foxy\x64\setup.bat`  Source the setup file

`cd C:\[Path To The Repo]\ros2_emulation\src` 

`call install\setup.bat` Source the workspace

`ros2 run ros_tcp_endpoint default_server_endpoint --ros-args -p ROS_IP:='your ip address' -p ROS_TCP_PORT:=10000`



Note:

This part is only for development use. In regular procedure, we have start-up script that help us run this part automatically in Unity.

### Folder structure

Our folder structure follows the structure of standard [ROS2 workspace](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html)

### Add dependencies

In ROS2, we usually add dependencies in CmakeLists.txt and Package.xml. In general, these two files tell what dependencies the package needs.

For some build-in package, like 'rclcpp', 'std_msgs',  we just simply add them by `find_package(package REQUIRED)` in CmakeLists.txt and `<depend>package</depend>` `  in Package.xml

For other non-build-in package, like 'Spinnaker' for FLIR camera and 'Simple-ble' for kick button. We have to manually add the dependencies with cmake command and link the library. You can follow the steps [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.html?highlight=library). Note that for 'Spinnaker', this doesn't work so we used another way to add the dependency. You can check it in CmakeLists.txt as well as ap_interfaces/cmake/FindSpinnaker.cmake for details. (If you want to use the FLIR camera in a new PC, you need to **change the address in FindSpinnaer.cmake**. I hard coded this part.)

## ROS2-Unity Bridge

We use [this officially supported Repo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/tree/main) for the connection between ROS2 and Unity part. 

### Key Scripts

* [player_detection.cpp]({{< ref "/player-detection-script" >}})

* [button.cpp]({{< ref "/button-script" >}})

### Latency Tests

* **pub_diff**: We measured the time difference between every two publishing messages. This file can be found in the first src folder.
* **detect_duration**: We measured the latency for player detection code. This file can be found in the first src folder.
* The implementation of these latency tests can be found in [player_detection.cpp]({{< ref "/player-detection-script" >}}).
