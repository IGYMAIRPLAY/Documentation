title: "Shapes Catcher"
---
## Overview
A virtual emitter in the center of the field constantly emits random shapes (e.g. circle, square, triangle) towards both halves of the field. Players on both sides compete to collect shapes that match their peripersonal boundary to earn points. Players can change their boundary shape by having a partner click on a keyboard button.

## Rules
The game begins when the moderator starts the timer. Two timers will be correspondingly displayed at the center of the field. A player scores a point by contacting a shape that matches their peripersonal boundary. Players with the kick button should be assigned to the left side of the field. All players should try to stay on their side of the field because a player's score is added to the field they are currently on. In other words, by being on the opponent's field, a player is helping their opponent collect their shapes. At the end of the timer, the winner, or the side with the most points, will have a crown displayed on their field.
