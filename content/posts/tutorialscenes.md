There are multiple scenes that have been created to guide first-time users of the system. Each scene corresponds to their own keyboard input so the moderator can freely skip between them as they see fit.
* Blank - This is an empty scene used to activate and adjust the cameras so that the game field is accurately displayed. This scene corresponds to the keyboard input 0.
* Easy - Shows the speed and size of the ball for the easy mode. This scene corresponds to the keyboard input 1.
