## Introduction 

Welcome to the ros-test-out wiki! ros-test-out is the repository for the Unity part of the entire [iGYM system](https://www.igym.solutions/). iGYM aims to build games that are inclusive and fun for people of all abilities. We use projectors to display a virtual game field for players to physically interact with. Through the implementation of peripersonal boundaries and kick buttons, we level the playing field between people with motor disabilities and their non-disabled peers.

Currently, we have two games that are implemented:
* [Air Hockey]({{< ref "/airhockey" >}})
* [Shape Catcher]({{< ref "/shapecatcher" >}})
