## Introduction 

Welcome to the documentation website for AiRPlay! iGYM aims to build games that are inclusive and fun for people of all abilities. We use projectors to display a virtual game field for players to physically interact with. Through the implementation of peripersonal boundaries and kick buttons, we level the playing field between people with motor disabilities and their non-disabled peers.
