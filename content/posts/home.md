## Introduction 

Welcome to the documentation website for AiRPlay! iGYM aims to build games that are inclusive and fun for people of all abilities. We use projectors to display a virtual game field for players to physically interact with. Through the implementation of peripersonal boundaries and kick buttons, we level the playing field between people with motor disabilities and their non-disabled peers.

## Onboarding

**Unity**：

- Our project uses Unity version 2020.3.16f1, so it is recommended that you install the same version
- Here is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM) on making a flappy bird game

**ROS2**：

- [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TVWlADXwRw) is a brief introduction to ROS2
- [Here]([Windows (binary) — ROS 2 Documentation: Foxy documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary.html))  is the ROS2 foxy official document to install (You might encounter some problems while creating a workspace)
- [Here](https://ms-iot.github.io/ROSOnWindows/GettingStarted/SetupRos2.html) is an alternative way to install (only in disk C) (recommended)
- To get a better understanding on ROS2, you can follow the [two beginner tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html) (Beginner: CLI tools and Beginner: Client libraries) in the official documentation

After being familiar with ROS2 and Unity, let's try the video version code:

switch both ros2_emulation and ros-test-out to the branch named 'video_test'.  Then open the Unity and follow the running procedure in the [ros2_emulation documentation]({{< ref "/ros2-emulation" >}}).
